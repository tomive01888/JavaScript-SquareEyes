## Description!


Client: 


- Online store: SquareEyes
  - Sells movies and series online

 
## Brief:
Using your new skills writing JavaScript, create an interactive online store to display product from an API endpoint. Use the provided API url to display products in HTML and allow users to create a basket of items.

## My job:
To ensure the "client" gets a good layout and responsive website. Follow the instructed guidelines for my task and deliver a final product my "client" approves. With the help of JS functionalites to interact with the API endpoint and display the various information I get back. Displaying sales values, movies and series in a grid layout a long with clickable objects to take users to a descriptive page of any product.
This was our first assignment with the use of JS. With our time limit we had to make a Kanban board and design using Figma. Design had to be a balanced overall design and responsiveness with accessibilities included, using WAVE and W3C markup validations.

Key points to this task:
- Handle increase and decrease of quantity in basket
- Allow user to view basket and remove or reduce quantity
- User can "purchase" taking them to a confirmation page
